Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hello! I’m Marcela Aguilar, a Ph.D. candidate in Business Accounting at Rice University, with a background in economics and public policy. My research focuses on the role of accounting in informal economies, informed by my experience working with the International Labour Organization in Central America and the Caribbean.

I’m passionate about using research to address real-world challenges, especially in developing economies. Over the years, I’ve contributed to policy development, microenterprise growth, and social issues like child labor and education, collaborating with various organizations and institutions.

Outside of work, I enjoy chess and have had the honor of being a National Female Chess Champion, I also love traveling and learning from new cultures. :airplane: :chess_pawn:

Thank you for visiting my site! :smile:
