Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've been fortunate to receive several recognitions that have supported my growth and development. I’m happy to share some of them here.

During my years as a competitive chess player, I gained invaluable experience in strategic thinking, critical decision-making, and performing under pressure. Representing El Salvador internationally strengthened my teamwork and competitive skills. Here are some highlights from those experiences.

Regarding my academic journey, I’m honored to have received the **York Award** for exceptional academic performance, the **Deloitte Foundation Doctoral Fellowship** for research potential, and the prestigious **Chevening Scholarship** from the British Government to study my master.

Internationally, I’ve had the opportunity to present at various significant conferences and forums. In 2024, I served as a discussant at the FARS conference and presented at the Understanding the Informal Economy Forum in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Earlier, in 2019, I shared my insights at the Global Knowledge Sharing Forum on Informal Economy in Turin, Italy, and the Global Youth Employment Forum in Abuja, Nigeria, focusing on the informal economy. These presentations have allowed me to engage with diverse audiences and contribute to important discussions in my field.
