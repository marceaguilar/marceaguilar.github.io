## Who is Mia?

**Mia is a 24/7 AI mentor that lives on WhatsApp.** She helps microentrepreneurs in the informal economy improve how they run their businesses—through friendly, simple, and practical guidance rooted in ILO’s *[Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB)](https://www.ilo.org/publications/siyb-implementation-guide)* curriculum.


### Real Conversations: Mia Talks with Entrepreneurs

Sometimes, text isn’t enough. Mia also supports **voice interactions** — a powerful feature for entrepreneurs who prefer to speak or listen rather than type and read. 

Below is an example from the field:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h5><i class="fa-solid fa-microphone-lines"></i> Entrepreneur's Voice Note</h5>
    <audio controls>
      <source src="{{ '/assets/audio/mia/empresario1.mp3' | relative_url }}" type="audio/mpeg">
      Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
    <p class="caption mt-2">An entrepreneur asks Mia for help understanding how to price her handmade goods.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h5><i class="fa-solid fa-robot"></i> Mia's Audio Reply</h5>
    <audio controls>
      <source src="{{ '/assets/audio/mia/mia_responde1.mp3' | relative_url }}" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>
    <p class="caption mt-2">Mia responds with tailored guidance on pricing strategies based on costs and competition.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## What Can Mia Do?

Mia engages in interactive conversations with entrepreneurs about:
- Marketing
- Costing and pricing
- Financial management
- Business planning 
- Inventory
- Human resource management

She doesn't just *tell* entrepreneurs what to do, she works *with them* through questions, examples, and calculators.

## Why It Matters

Most small businesses in the informal economy lack access to tailored training or mentorship. Mia fills that gap by offering:
- Continuous support (day and night)
- Personalized business logic
- Financial framing to build **financial acumen at scale**
